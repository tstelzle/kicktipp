# Kicktipp

## Extract Data 
The main.py script allows you to extract the data from your kicktipp group.
Set the name of your kicktipp group in the credentials.txt and run main.py

## Calculate Table
The calculate.py calculates the overall table for the kicktipp group.
By default it uses the values in the constant.txt. 
You can change them to calculate the outcome of your group with different setups. 

## Further Information
For now the programm can only download all tables from the group.
There is no option yet to define how and which "Spieltage" to download.
